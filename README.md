This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

_Keep in mind that this will not work if you don't have the relevant environment variables. For Spring Financial you should just use the deployed version of the website to test the functionality._

```bash
yarn

yarn dev
```
